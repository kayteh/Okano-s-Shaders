# Okano's Shaders

Okano's Unity Shaders. Big mishmash of reworked, original, and mixed shaders.

Built and tested in Unity 5.6.3p1 for VRChat and partially tested in 2018.1.

Most of these do not replace the real shaders for most uses.

## Shaders

- **Cubed Flat Lit Toon Stencil** - Stencil diffused version of FLT, with custom editor for helping it.
- **Deep Fried** - A very very very very meme-y shader. Fakes JPEG crushing and yellowing. Use at your own risk.
- **Scuffed Glitter** - **SCUFFED** glitter-y effect. WIP.
- **NoeNoe Emission Scroll** - Applies the overlay texture scroll mechanics to the emission map.
- **NoeNoe Cutout** - Cutout version of NoeNoe
- **NoeNoe Opaque Rework** - Changes light multiplier to re-emit the output color as if it was the emission map. Also includes Stencil version.
- **NoeNoe Opaque Stencil** - Stencil diffused version of NoeNoe.
- **NoeNoe Opaque Sparkle** - Applies a controllable perlin noise light filter over the emission map.
- **Stencil Mask** - Helper shader for mask materials, allows per-material Ref values.
- **Wireframe Overlay** - ([See docs](https://github.com/kayteh/shaders/blob/master/Docs/Wireframe.md)) An optionally shaded wireframe overlay texture with a scrolling wireframe texture.
- **Transparent** - Very efficient pure alpha shader for lazy people.

### TODO

- Option-based stencils
- Custom NoeNoe Editor to combine the set
- Dissolve Edge, Bail Edition
