# Okano's Shaders

Okano's Unity Shaders. Big mishmash of reworked, original, and mixed shaders.

## Shaders

- **Cubed Flat Lit Toon Stencil** - Stencil diffused version of FLT, with custom editor for helping it.
- **NoeNoe Emission Scroll** - Applies the overlay texture scroll mechanics to the emission map.
- **NoeNoe Opaque Rework** - Changes light multiplier to re-emit the output color as if it was the emission map.
- **NoeNoe Opaque Stencil** - Stencil diffused version of NoeNoe.
- **Stencil Mask** - Helper shader for mask materials, allows per-material Ref values.
- **Wireframe Overlay** - ([See docs](https://github.com/kayteh/shaders/blob/master/Docs/Wireframe.md)) An optionally shaded wireframe overlay texture with a scrolling wireframe texture.

### TODO

- Option-based stencils  
- NoeNoe Sparkling Emission
