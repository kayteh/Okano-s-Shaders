# Wireframe
Formerly Nyanowire.

Designed and tested for Unity 5.6.3p1 & VRChat.

These are not made in ShaderForge; however, it uses code from other ShaderForge-made textures.

- **Main Texture** - (Shaded Only) - The texture to draw under the wireframe.
- **Base Color** - A matte color to draw under the wireframe.
- **Wireframe Texture** - The texture to draw on the wireframe. This is a rainbow by default.
- **Wireframe Texture Speed** - How fast the wireframe texture will scroll. 0 is an acceptable speed, and 0.1 is a small color change effect.
- **Wire Thickness** - 0-800, controls the size of the wireframe.
- **Wire Intensity** - 0-20, controls brightness, emissivity, and opacity.
- **Max Tri Size** - *I'm honestly unsure what this does at this time.*
